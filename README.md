# Astro Demo

This repo is the result of my learning process of using the Astro framework.
The goal is to generate a static website. I will document all the operations done below.

## What have I done

```sh
npm create astro@latest
npm run astro add svelte
npm run astro add tailwind
```

- Replaced some assets
- Edited `Welcome.astro` `Layout.astro`
- Added a workflow to automatic deploy
- Changed `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs`

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
